Smart Classroom
--------------------

### Background

While taking classes in Ithaca during the summer, participation was a significant portion of each students grade for almost every class. Teachers would track it though by trying to haphazardly make a mark on a printout of students' faces while speaking, or even worse try to remember who said what. Teachers also get feedback only through reviews at the end of the semester when students are already checked out and don't want to spend time thinking about the past semester.

### Problem Addressing

This made me realize classrooms haven't changed except for maybe the projector for a very long time, and utilize no technology.

### Challenge

To make a 'smart classroom' leveraging technology such as beacons and cameras (facial recognition, eye direction, body movements, facial expressions, etc) to change the way participation is graded, teachers get feedback, etc etc

### Scenario

When class starts, beacons check to see if all smartphones are in the room ie all students are present. It can be validated with facial recognition. The app on the teachers computer can allow the ability to send questions throughout class making sure students are keeping up with material and give quiet students good participation grades. Quizzical and confused student expressions can be tracked and overlayed with teacher text so the teacher can see where students were confused. Many more features could be built on top of this work.
