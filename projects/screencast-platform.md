Screencasting Platform
-----
This is a project idea. No work has been started on this project yet.

### Background
With the prevalence of personal computers and smartphones, people have ended up isolating themselves. Because of the nature of personal devices, web browsing is an activity that is done in solitude. This is especially unsettling when people are physically in the same room, a phenomenon discussed in Sherry Turkle's book "Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other". 

### Challenge
To increase interaction between internet users, a platform should be created where users are able to broadcast or share their screens as they browse surf the world wide web. This can introduce a social aspect to web browsing that was previously done by asynchronous link sharing or having to use a web calling service to formally invite another person to share your screen. By using a broadcasting platform, users makes the experience of joint web browsing much more casual and more like a true hangout in cyberspace. With such a platform, friends can join in on one's Netflix binge, read along and react with each other to the same article, watch and play online games together, and many more possibilities.
